## Fill the table

Data type | Number of bits | Range | Description |
--------- | -------------- | ----- | ----------- |
uint8_t   |       8        | 0 - 255 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
int8_t |     8   |  -128 - 127  |  Signed 8-bit integer |
uint16_t |  16  |  0 - 65353  | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
int16_t |   16   | -32768 - 32767 | Signed 16-bits integer |
float |  | -3,4e38 - 3,4e38  | Single-precision floating-point |
void | |  | specifies that the function does not return a value |

## Differences

*Explain the differences between function declaration-definition*

* The definition of an element of the program, determines the value associated with that element. In other part, the declaration of a program element specifies its name and type to the compiler.
* The definition reserve a certain amount of memory, while the declaration doesn`t imply memory allocation.
* A program element can be declarated many times. On the other side, the definition incorporates a unique specification with the name of the program element that could be distinguished by any code or data.
* The scope in the declaration describes the visibility of the variable, function, object, class, enum, etc. In contrast, in the definition scope is related to duration.
